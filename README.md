Ansible automation to provision an RHEL for Edge Environments

## Solution Overview

This approach focuses on the Ansible automation being driven through a containerized environment with Ansible running on the edge node. As new edge nodes are created, a container using the [ansible-runner](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner) image executes the Ansible automation to provision the edge node

## Prerequisites

### Download dependencies

Execute the following commands to download the required dependencies

```shell
ansible-galaxy role install -r collections/requirements.yaml
```

### Populate Inventory

Add the Image Builder instance(s) into the [hosts](inventory/hosts) file.

### Subscription Information

The content within this repository leverages Red Hat RPM's. The automation to manage subscribing the machines and repositories makes use of the [rhsm](https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra-ansible/blob/master/roles/rhsm) role within the [infra-ansible](https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra-ansible) repository.

It is recommended to add the necessary values to a separate file and inject it in as an extra parameter using `-e @<filename>` when executing the playbook. An example can be found below:

```yaml
---
rhsm_username: "<password>"
rhsm_password: "<username>"
```

**Note:** If your machine is already subscribed, you can skip registration by passing `-e rhsm_manage=false`.

## Provision

Execute the following command in order to provision the machine:

```shell
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ playbooks/image_builder.yaml
```

Once provisioning is complete, a HTTPD container that exposes the RFE image and kickstart file on port 8000.

## Edge Nodes

Since the above automation exposes the kickstart file and the edge image, boot the RHEL edge instance and add the kickstart arguments as follows:

```shell
inst.ks=http://<image_builder_node>:8000/kickstart.ks
```

## Edge Automation

The key attribute of this architecture is that edge instances configure themselves by executing Ansible automation. This automation lives on a in the `ansible-edge` branch of this repository. A timer systemd service is configured to execute the automation on a regular basis.
