Ansible automation managed through Ansible Tower to provision a RHEL for Edge Environments

## Solution Overview

This approach focuses on Ansible Tower to centrally manage the automation for edge resources. As new edge nodes are created, a [Provisioning Callback](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html#provisioning-callbacks) triggers automation to be applied to edge node.

## Prerequisites

### Download dependencies

Execute the following commands to download the required dependencies

```shell
ansible-galaxy role install -r collections/requirements.yaml
ansible-galaxy role collection -r collections/requirements.yaml
```

### Populate Inventory

Add the Image Builder instance(s) into the [hosts](inventory/hosts) file.

### Subscription Information

The content within this repository leverages Red Hat RPM's. The automation to manage subscribing the machines and repositories makes use of the [rhsm](https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra-ansible/blob/master/roles/rhsm) role within the [infra-ansible](https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra-ansible) repository.

It is recommended to add the necessary values to a separate file and inject it in as an extra parameter using `-e @<filename>` when executing the playbook. An example can be found below:

```yaml
---
rhsm_username: "<password>"
rhsm_password: "<username>"
```

**Note:** If your machine is already subscribed, you can skip registration by passing `-e rhsm_manage=false`.

## Ansible Tower

Ansible automation is performed via Ansible Tower and Provisioning Callbacks. Automation is available to configure an existing Ansible Tower environment.

Similar to the subscription details as described in the prior section, it is recommended that you place the following parameters in a separate file called `tower_creds.yaml` which will be added as extra variables when invoking the `ansible-playbook` command:

```yaml
---
tower_hostname: https://<tower_host>
tower_validate_certs: false
tower_username: <username>
tower_password: <password>
```

A playbook at [playbooks/config_tower.yaml](playbooks/config_tower.yaml) is available to perform the automation. This playbook makes use of resources defined in the group variables file [inventory/group_vars/tower.yaml](inventory/group_vars/tower.yaml). A few important points to note regarding the defined variables:

* A default static value for the `host_config_key` representing the key used by the Provisioning Callback. It is recommended that an alternate value be specified
* The `tower_hosts` contains the hosts that should be added to the inventory group. By default, no hosts are defined. Add any hosts that should be eligible to make use of the Provisioning Callback.

Execute the playbook by using the following command:

```shell
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ -c local playbooks/config_tower.yaml -e @tower_creds.yml
```

Ansible Tower can be manually configured instead of using the automation by performing the following steps:

### Credentials

Add a new [Machine Credential](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html) called **rfe** that will be used to connect to edge devices.

Enter the _username_ and _password_ of the edge device. By default, it is configured as _core_ and _edge_respectively. Be sure to also enter the password in the _Privilege Escalation Password_ field.

### Project

Add a new [Project](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/projects.html) called **rfe-ansible-mgmt** that references the branch containing the automation.

Enter the SCM URL using the HTTPS clone address and the branch `ansible-edge`

### Inventory

Create a new [Inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/inventories.html) called **rfe** containing the following:

* Group called **localhost**
* Add the addresses of all edge devices as members to the of this group

### Job Template

Create a new Job template called **rfe** to execute the automation against the edge nodes:

* Associate the _rfe_ inventory
* Associate the _rfe-mgmt-ansible_. Select the **playbooks/rfe.yaml** playbook
* Associate te _rfe_ credential

Under _options_, select the following:

* Enable privilege escalation
* Enable provisioning callback

After selecting "Enable provisioning callback", generate a new Host config key. The Provisioning Callback URL and Host Config Key is required to be specified later.

## Provision

Execute the following command in order to provision the machine being sure to substitute the callback url and host config key in the extra variable parameters as shown below:

```shell
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ playbooks/image_builder.yaml -e '{"ansible_tower":{ "callback_url": "<callback_url>", "host_config_key":"<host_config_key>" }}'
```

Once provisioning is complete, a HTTPD container that exposes the RFE image and kickstart file on port 8000.

## Edge Nodes

Since the above automation exposes the kickstart file and the edge image, boot the RHEL edge instance and add the kickstart arguments as follows:

```shell
inst.ks=http://<image_builder_node>:8000/kickstart.ks
```

## Edge Automation

The key attribute of this architecture is that edge instances configure themselves by executing Ansible automation. This automation lives on a in the `ansible-edge` branch of this repository. A timer systemd service is configured to trigger the automation on a regular basis.
